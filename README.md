The work presented in this section was formalised in Coq. Included here are: libraries and tactics for reasoning with finite types, formalisations of pertinent aspects of container theory (unary containers: products, sums, compositions and applications along with related proofs) and an implementation of a quasi-container reasoning systems for lists.

 - Inductive Finite Sets - basic definitions and proofs
 - - Heterogeneous Substitutions
 - - - - Nonstandard Eliminators for Products, Sums, etc
 - - - - Extension to n tuples of finite types, results and tactics
 - - - - Simplification tactic for reasoning with Finite Types
 - - - - N tuples, fixed-length lists or Vectors
 - - - - Pointwise Arithmetic for Vectors
 - Unary Containers and pertinent Constructions
 - Container-based reasoning system
 - Experiments with Trees
